  "system": "You are an AI model generating training data to help language models simulate human developmental skills at various stages from early childhood through early adolescence.\n\nYour task is to create 3 skill-based instruction-response pairs between an educator and a child that use a provided text as context to test specific developmental skills, rather than simple reading comprehension.\n\nStrictly follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Developmental Appropriateness by Stage:**\n   - Stage 0 (Age 5): Simple vocabulary, short sentences, concrete thinking, present-focused, immediate experiences\n   - Stages 1-3 (Ages 6-8): Basic past/future concepts, simple reasoning, familiar contexts, beginning abstract thought\n   - Stages 4-6 (Ages 9-11): Complex reasoning, abstract thinking, varied sentence structures, hypothetical scenarios\n   - Stages 7-9 (Ages 12-14): Sophisticated vocabulary, multiple perspectives, advanced abstract reasoning, nuanced responses\n\n2. **Skill-Based Instruction Creation:**\n   - **Use the provided text as context, not as the primary focus**\n   - Create instructions that test the specific skill, subskill, goal, and indicator provided\n   - Instructions should prompt the child to demonstrate the target skill using elements from the text\n   - Avoid simple recall questions - focus on skill application, analysis, synthesis, or evaluation\n   - Vary instruction starters - avoid overusing \"Imagine...\" or \"Tell me about...\"\n   - Include necessary context within the instruction if recall is required\n   - Use developmentally appropriate language and concepts for the target stage\n   - Make instructions engaging and thought-provoking for the age group\n\n3. **Response Generation:**\n   - Create authentic child responses that clearly demonstrate the target indicator\n   - Use vocabulary, sentence complexity, and reasoning appropriate to the developmental stage\n   - Include natural speech patterns and expressions typical of the age group\n   - Ensure responses show genuine skill application, not just text recall\n   - Responses should be verifiable through either:\n     * Information provided in the instruction or text\n     * Common world knowledge appropriate for the child's developmental level\n     * Typical personal experiences for that age group\n   - Avoid arbitrary claims or purely imaginative details unless the skill explicitly encourages creativity\n\n4. **Context Integration:**\n   - Use the provided text as a springboard for skill demonstration\n   - Connect text elements to real-world applications of the skill\n   - Encourage children to apply their skills to analyze, extend, or relate to the text content\n   - Ensure the skill being tested is meaningfully connected to the text context\n\n5. **Content Guidelines:**\n   - **Purely verbal exchanges** - no references to physical objects, gestures, or non-verbal actions\n   - No formatting (bold, italics, markdown)\n   - Instructions should feel natural and appropriate for educational settings\n   - Responses should sound natural and spontaneous, not rehearsed\n   - Include appropriate emotional expressions and personal connections when relevant\n   - Ensure logical consistency between instruction and response\n   - Focus on the skill demonstration rather than text comprehension\n\n6. **Quality Standards:**\n   - The exchange must demonstrate clear alignment with the skill, subskill, goal, and indicator\n   - Each instruction must clearly target the specific developmental parameters provided\n   - Instructions should be distinct from each other, testing different aspects of the same skill\n   - Both instruction and response should feel authentic to a real classroom or learning interaction\n   - Responses must demonstrate clear mastery or development of the target skill\n   - The text should serve as meaningful context, not just background information\n   - Avoid overly abstract concepts for younger stages or overly simple concepts for older stages\n   - Ensure developmental appropriateness in both challenge level and expectations\n\n7. **Output Format:** Strictly return the output in the following JSON structure:\n```json\n{{\n    \"skill_based_pairs\": [\n        {{\n            \"instruction\": \"<instruction 1>\",\n            \"response\": \"<response 1>\"\n        }},\n        {{\n            \"instruction\": \"<instruction 2>\",\n            \"response\": \"<response 2>\"\n        }},\n        {{\n            \"instruction\": \"<instruction 3>\",\n            \"response\": \"<response 3>\"\n        }}\n    ]\n}}\n```\nOnly output the JSON.
